= Kubernetes - Setup Cloud9 Development Environment
:toc:

This section walks you through the creating a Kubernetes development environment using https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9].  This will provide you with a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that will let you write, run, and debug containerized workloads using just a web browser.

== Create AWS Cloud9 Environment
=== AWS Cloud9 Console

We can create the Cloud9 development environment via CloudFormation.
This CloudFormation template will spin up the Cloud9 IDE, as well as configure the IDE environment for the rest of the workshop.

The CloudFormation template can create a new VPC, or you can choose an existing VPC if needed.
If you are unsure, we recommend the "Launch template with an existing VPC" option.

Click on the "Deploy to AWS" button and follow the CloudFormation prompts to begin.

[NOTE]
AWS Cloud9 is currently available in 5 regions, and EKS is currently available in 2 regions (us-east-1 and us-west-2).
Please choose the region closest to you.  If you choose a region for Cloud9 that does not support EKS, you need to create VPC resources and change environment variables. This configuration has not been tested.

Accept the default stack name and Click *Next*. You can give Tags such as Key=Name, Value=k8s-workshop, and click *Next*. Make sure
to check *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names* and click *Create*.

CloudFormation creates nested stacks and builds several resources that are required for this workshop. Wait until all the resources are created. Once the status for *k8s-workshop* changes to *CREATE_COMPLETE*,
you can open Cloud9 IDE. To open the Cloud9 IDE environment, click on the "Outputs" tab in CloudFormation Console and click on the "Cloud9IDE" URL.

You should see an environment similar to this:

=== Cloud9 Instance Role

The Cloud9 IDE needs to use the assigned IAM Instance profile. Open the "AWS Cloud9" menu, go to "Preferences", go to "AWS Settings", and disable "AWS managed temporary credentials" as depicted in the diagram here:

=== Build Script

Once your Cloud9 is ready, download the build script and install in your IDE. This will prepare your IDE for running tutorials in this workshop. The build script installs the following:

- jq
- kubectl _(the Kubernetes CLI, which we'll cover in great detail later in the workshop)_
- heptio/authenticator _(for authentication to the EKS cluster)_
- updates/configures the AWS CLI and stores necessary environment variables in bash_profile
- kops _(Kubernetes Operations, which we'll also cover in detail later)_
- creates an SSH key
- clone the workshop repository into Cloud9

To install the script, run this command in the "bash" terminal tab of the Cloud9 IDE:

    aws s3 cp s3://aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/lab-ide-build.sh . && \
    chmod +x lab-ide-build.sh && \
    . ./lab-ide-build.sh

image:cloud9-run-script.png[Running the script in Cloud9 Terminal]

Remove the original repo and clone this forked Git repo to your Cloud9 instance:

    rm -rf aws-workshop-for-kubernetes && git clone https://github.com/sbruggeman/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point you can restart the Cloud9 IDE terminal session to ensure that the kubectl completion is enabled. Once a new terminal window is opened, type `kubectl ver` and press `Tab` to autocomplete and press `Enter`. This will ensure that the `kubectl` tool is installed on the command line correctly and can autocomplete.

[NOTE]
All shell commands _(starting with "$")_ throughout the rest of the workshop should be run in this tab. You may want to resize it upwards to make it larger.

You are now ready to continue on with the workshop!
